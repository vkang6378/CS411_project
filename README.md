1. Finding the best place for the any occasion
  For example, find the best place for individual study or team work. First, we can measure the space, the area and the student seating capacity of the place. Larger the space or the area, the better; the more moderate the seating capacity, the better. We may search for and set up the best number of meduim seating capacity. Second, we can measure the height of chairs and desks, calculate the ratio of heights, and compare 
  
  We can measure the space, the view, the comfort level of chairs and desks, and how many students that usually study here, and any other aspects that may affect our study envrionment and passion. light: bulb light and natural light. the height of chairs and desks, how it fits body structure. individual study or team work. temperature. the distance between the study place and the restroom. the noise, the distance to the driveways, bus station, and the T. 

2. Using twitter, finding popular events that are happening in the area. 
  For example, based on yoir recent likes and posts, reccomend a concert or a sporting event you can attend to. First, we can send the twitter feed to Watson or any other IBM database or API that will scan the keywords or content that a person is consuming. Then, make a search through a database like ticketmaster, or a event search hub that will return what events are happening within the area that matches the users interests.
  For example, maybe if someone shares and likes a lot of Celtics content, fins nearby games, stores or events related to the celtics. If someone likes to run maybe find races nearby. It uses twitter as third party, and data from event sites.
